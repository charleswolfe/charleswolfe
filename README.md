I like building things that work well.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on software systems big and small, some from scratch, some half-broken when I found them. Iâ€™ve led teams, cleaned up old code, written new tools, and spent a lot of time figuring out how to make things better, not just different.

I care about clarity, about doing things right, and about solving real problems. I write code in Python, TypeScript, PHP, and JavaScript - they get the job done.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been working on personal projects that give me room to experiment, think, and build with fewer constraints. Thatâ€™s where the good ideas come from anyway.
