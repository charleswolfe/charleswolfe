# Hi, I'm Charles Wolfe ðŸ‘‹

ðŸš€ About Me
Iâ€™ve spent years developing software, solving complex problems, and leading teams through ambitious projects. Whether Iâ€™m designing cloud-native applications, improving legacy systems, or diving deep into automation, I approach every challenge with a commitment to quality and innovation. 

Iâ€™m not just a coder, Iâ€™m a builder at heart. I love bringing ideas to life, collaborating with others, and driving progress forward.

ðŸ”­ Currently working on personal projects involving Python, Typescript, PHP and Java
